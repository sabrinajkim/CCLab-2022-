            <p>
                Sword dance (geommu) also known as kalchum, is a militaristic yet graceful dance that roots back to a tale of a boy named Hwangchang who had incredible prowess for dancing with the sword, so much so that the king of a rival kingdom invited him to come and perform in his court. The boy ended up slaying the king, and was killed himself afterwards. His home kingdom honored him, however, by dancing with swords and masks in his honor.

            <img src="../images/fan dance.jpeg" alt style=" width: 100%;">
            <p>
                Fan dance is known for its beautiful colors and movements. Its origins date back to the Joseon Dynasty(1392-1910). The movements of the dance evoke natural phenomena, from the color and fringes of the peony-colored fans, to the many formations that recall blooming trees, flowers, and natural waves. This choreography and costuming are closely related to the shamanic religious tradition of the Korean spiritual beliefs.

                Janggu, a national percussion instrument, has been used since Koguryo Kingdom (B.C. 277-A.D. 668).

Originally, the Janggu dance was a part of peasant dance and song-and-dance play. It was developed into an independent item like solo dance and group dance with rich dance movements.

This dance is characterized by zestful rhythmic movements and strong national emotion.
